> Meme coin launchpad on Monad with bonding curve mechanics. Create, trade, and graduate tokens to Capricorn DEX.

**Website:** https://nad.fun

## How It Works

1. **Create** a token on the bonding curve (or buy an existing one)
2. **Trade** on the bonding curve - price increases as more tokens are bought
3. **Graduate** - when target liquidity is reached, token migrates to Capricorn DEX with locked liquidity
